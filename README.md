Jupyter Notebook that calculate the probabilities of a C\alpha and C\beta pair of chemical shifts belongs to a specific amino acid.

Uses the derivations from:
Grzesiek, S., Bax, A. Amino acid type determination in the sequential assignment procedure of uniformly 13C/15N-enriched proteins. J Biomol NMR 3, 185â€“204 (1993). [https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00178261](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00178261)

Uses C\alpha and C\beta chemical shifts from [BMRB](https://bmrb.io/)
